Foreboding is a virtual reality game based off HP Lovecraft and tries to invoke a feeling of uneasiness and foreboding. The player is in an old and decrepit mansion. Notes scattered throughout the mansion which gives clues to what is happening. The mansion has an alter buried deep within it, and when 4 pages of the Necronomicon are found and placed around the alter, the player will invoke the Old Ones. If the player collects all the notes in the game, the ending will show a conglomeration of glowing spheres and large, ominous beingings appear before the player loses their sanity. If all note pages are not collected, Cthulhu will appear and consume the player...

Cthulhu was 3D modeled in a VR program called Google Blocks. 

The vast majority of my time was spent testing experimental interactions, most of which did not feel right or work out how I had hoped. My goal was to convey foreboding through different types of interactions while keeping things unclear as to if there is something sinister lurking in the 

My game runs at a solid 90fps on my system. Here are my system specs in case that might matter:

- Intel i7-5820K @ 3.30GHz
- 12 GB DDR4 RAM
- GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
- HTC Vive

# List of Achievements #
## Fundamentals (600 points) ##
1. Scale achievement (100 points) - I have a room that changes the player's scale as a function of distance. There is a cabinet on the far side of the room that has a smaller version of the room which has an item in it that is needed to complete the game.
2. Animation achievement (100 points) - I animated an insect, a blobby thing, and have spatial audio sources that are animated to move around the player.
3. Lighting achievement (100 points) - My project contains baked and real-time lights throughout the game.
4. Physics achievement (100 points) - I have a room with furniture that, once activated, will add a brief force to each object, sending them slowly moving within the room (gravity is also turned off for this).
5. Video Player achievement (200 points) - I have a TV in the game that displays an important video that will help the player solve a puzzle (200 points since the lighting achievement was completed).

## Completeness (750 points) ##
1. Alternative Storyline achievement (250 points) - The player needs to collect 4 pages from the Necronomicon to finish the game. There are 8 journal pages which help the player along and provide some background. 2 endings were created - one if all journal pages are found, and one when not all are found.
2. AI achievement (250 points) - I wrote a simple flocking script to control a group of glowing orbs.
3. 3D Modeling achievement (250 points) - I created an insect, a blobby thing, and Cthulhu (a giant Elder God which has tentacles coming out its mouth) in Google Blocks.

## Challenges (500 points) ##
1. User Testing achievement (250 points x 2) - I had to separate user tests which helped me to improve my game. This lead to improvements in the ambiance of the game, the player's movement, and lighting suggestions to make the game "feel" better.
